Welcome to https://repl.it/@kevinawalsh/JavaExercises

This repository contains exercises for beginning Java programmers. These are 
meant to give you additional practice. They are roughly in order of difficulty,
but not entirely. Some involve mathematics or physics, but others don't, so feel 
free to skip around to find ones you like.

We may add new exercises from time to time, so check back later for more.

What to do:
  Click on one of the Java exercise files at the left, 
  read the comments in the file and add your own code,
  then click "run" above to test your solution.

What you should see:
  At the right, it will ask which exercise you would like to test.
  Input the number (e.g. 3), then hit enter. It will then
  compile your code with javac, and if all goes well, it will
  then run your code with the java command.
  Any errors compiling or running your code will appear on the
  right side.
  If your program uses keyboard input, just enter it using
  the console at right, exactly as you would with a regular
  terminal.

Java programming:
  You can use most any regular Java features, including printing,
  keyboard input, Math, and so on. You can also use the Sedgewick & Wayne
  Standard Library for Java Input/Output, as described here:
    https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/
  For example you can use:
    StdIn.readString(); // get a word from keyboard
    StdIn.readDouble(); // get a decimal number from keyboard
    StdIn.readInt(); // get an integer from keyboard
  and so on.

Saving your work:
  Each time you visit https://repl.it/@kevinawalsh/JavaExercises
  you will start fresh. When you leave, your work will be discarded.
  However, if you want to save your work and come back to it
  a few minutes later, you can! 
  Short-term saves: Simply start working, and notice that
  the URL  in your browser will change to something different, like
  https://repl.it/repls/WeeklyGargantuanPlot or some other random
  title. You can use this random URL to come back, and all your
  work will be there. This only works for a few minutes or hours,
  however. If you leave your work for too long, it will disappear.
  Permanent saves: You will need to create an account with 
  https://repl.it/ and log in. Once logged in, come back to this
  page -- any changes you make will now be saved in your account.

Good luck, and happy programming!
