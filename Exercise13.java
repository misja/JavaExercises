      // number of sides is an integer, but the length can be a decimal number.
      // The formula is:
      //   N times the square of the side length, divided by 4*K,
      //   where K is equal to tan(pi/N),
      //   and N is the number of sides entered by the user.
      // Hint: The Math library has a function for computing tan(x), i.e. tangent.
      
      // Add your code here, then click "run" to test it.
