      // prints their quotient and remainder in a nicely-formatted sentence. 
      // So if the user enters 23 and 5, it would print something like:
      // "23 divided by 5 is 4, with a remainder of 3."
      // Reminder: You can use StdIn.readInt() to input integers.

      // Add your code here, then click "run" to test it.
