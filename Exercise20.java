      // ask the user to input three numbers, a, b, and c, representing
      // the three coefficients of a quadratic equation. The
      // program should then calculate the determinant d (recall the
      // formula for this is: "b squared" minus "four a times c".
      // If d is negative, there are no real solutions to the quadratic equation,
      // so the program should print a message saying so.
      // If d is zero, there is only one real solution to the quadratic equation,
      // so the program should print a message saying so, along with
      // the solution (in this case, the solution is: "negative b divided by a").
      // Otherwise, if d is positive, there are two real solutions, and the
      // program should print them both (here the two solutions are: 
      // "minus b, plus or minus the square root of d, all over 2a").
